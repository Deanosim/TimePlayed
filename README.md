<h2>A customizable bot that tracks your playtime</h2>
The source code is no longer available in public, as I didn't really felt anyone was using it and it only gave me extra work. I will reupload the code when the bot becomes more popular and when I'm having multiple contributors, but for now I don't think it really adds that much.<br>
My full documentation can be found on <a href="https://timeplayed.xyz" target="_blank">my website</a>
